* Simple LoRAWAN Test for the Heltec WIFI LoRa 32 V2 module *

Simple LoRaWAN Client that sends an incrementing 32bit number as payload, and will display any bytes downlinked (only about 6 fit on the display)
You need to change DevEUI etc in main.cpp and configure the OTAA parameters in your LoraGateway Software.
